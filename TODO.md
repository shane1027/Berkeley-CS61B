- add javadoc comments to each function

- add description of project and gif of result

- nbodyextreme, allowing mouse interaction, collisions, launching of satellites
  from bodies, moon systems??

- maybe change into a big bang simulator --> start with huge subset of unit
  masses that fly off randomly, then speed up time a ton, and when they impact
  at a slow enough speed they group together, deleting two smaller objects and
  creating one larger one... until we have planets and orbits, etc...!
